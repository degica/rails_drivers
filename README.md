# RailsDrivers

## What are these "drivers"?

Each driver is like a mini Rails app that has full access to the main app. A driver has its own `app`, `config`, `spec`, and `db` folder.

Technically speaking, drivers are just a fancy name for putting code into a different folder. The advantage of doing this is that it provides clear-cut separation of concerns. If we follow a couple of simple rules, we can actually test that separation:

- Drivers should not touch other drivers
- The main app should not touch drivers directly

The "main app" refers to the files inside your `<project root>/app` directory.

If your test suite is good, you can test that these rules are adhered to by selectively adding and removing drivers before running your tests.

## Aren't these just engines?

Very similar, yes. They use the same Rails facilities for adding new `app` paths, etc.

But Drivers have less friction. They can be freely added and removed from your project without breaking anything. There's no need to mess around with gems, vendoring, or dummy apps.

## Usage

Every folder inside `drivers` has its own `app`, `config`, `db`, and `spec` folders. They are effectively a part of the overall Rails app.

### Creating a new driver

Just run `rails g driver my_new_driver_name`.

### Creating migrations for a driver

`bundle exec driver my_driver_name generate migration blah etc_etc:string`

The `driver` utility technically works with other generators and rake tasks, but is only guaranteed to work with migrations.
The reason is that some generators assume a particular path, rather than using the Rails path methods.

### Testing for coupling

Since drivers are merged into your main application just like engines, there's nothing stopping them from accessing other drivers, and there's nothing stopping your main application from accessing drivers. In order to ensure those things don't happen, we have a handful of rake tasks:

1. `rake driver:isolate[<name of driver>] # leaves you with only one driver`
2. `rake driver:clear                     # removes all drivers`
3. `rake driver:restore                   # restores all drivers`

Suppose you have a driver called `store` and a driver called `admin`. You don't want `store` and `admin` to talk to each other.

```bash
# Run specs with store driver only
rake driver:isolate[store]
rspec --pattern '{spec,drivers/*/spec}/**{,/*/**}/*_spec.rb'
rake driver:restore

# Run specs with admin driver only
rake driver:isolate[admin]
rspec --pattern '{spec,drivers/*/spec}/**{,/*/**}/*_spec.rb'
rake driver:restore
```

This lets you to ensure that the store and admin function properly without each other. Note we're running all of the main app's specs twice. This is good because we also want to make sure the main app is not reaching into drivers.

Of course there's nothing stopping you from using if-statements to detect whether a driver is present. It's up to you to determine what's a "safe" level of crossover. Generally, if you find yourself using a lot of those if-statements, you should consider rethinking which functionality belongs in a driver and which functionality belongs in your main app.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_drivers'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle install
```

Add this line to your routes.rb:

```ruby
require 'rails_drivers/routes'

# This can go before or after your application's route definitions
RailsDrivers::Routes.load_driver_routes
```

### RSpec

If you use RSpec, add these lines to your `spec/rails_helper.rb` or `spec/spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
Dir[Rails.root.join("drivers/*/spec/support/*.rb")].each { |f| require f }

RSpec.configure do |config|
  Dir[Rails.root.join('drivers/*/spec')].each { |x| config.project_source_dirs << x }
  Dir[Rails.root.join('drivers/*/lib')].each { |x| config.project_source_dirs << x }
  Dir[Rails.root.join('drivers/*/app')].each { |x| config.project_source_dirs << x }
end
```

### Webpacker

If you use Webpacker, take a look at this snippet. You'll want to add the code between the comments:

```javascript
// config/webpack/environment.js
const { environment } = require('@rails/webpacker')

//// Begin driver code ////
const { config } = require('@rails/webpacker')
const { sync } = require('glob')
const { basename, dirname, join, relative, resolve } = require('path')
const extname = require('path-complete-extname')

const getExtensionsGlob = () => {
  const { extensions } = config
  return extensions.length === 1 ? `**/*${extensions[0]}` : `**/*{${extensions.join(',')}}`
}

const addToEntryObject = (sourcePath) => {
  const glob = getExtensionsGlob()
  const rootPath = join(sourcePath, config.source_entry_path)
  const paths = sync(join(rootPath, glob))
  paths.forEach((path) => {
    const namespace = relative(join(rootPath), dirname(path))
    const name = join(namespace, basename(path, extname(path)))
    environment.entry.set(name, resolve(path))
  })
}

sync('drivers/*').forEach((driverPath) => {
  addToEntryObject(join(driverPath, config.source_path));
})
//// End driver code ////

module.exports = environment
```
